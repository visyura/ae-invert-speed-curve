# After Effect time remap curve inverser

This script calculates the inverse of a time remap speed curve in After Effects.
When the original time-remapped layer and the generated inverse layer are combined, they cancel each other out, resulting in linear playback at normal speed.

**Important**: The script processes the curve frame-by-frame, which completely degrades audio quality in the output layer.
